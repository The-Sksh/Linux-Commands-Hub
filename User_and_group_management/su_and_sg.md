## **1. `su` (Switch User)**

The `su` (substitute user) command allows a user to switch to another user account, including root. By default, it switches to root if no username is provided.

### **Syntax:**

```bash
su [OPTIONS] [USERNAME] [--] [ARGUMENTS]

```

### **Options and Use Cases:**

| Option | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `-` or `-l` | Switches to the user with a full login shell (loads the user's environment and profile). | `su - john` |
| `-c "command"` | Executes a single command as another user. | `su -c "whoami" john` |
| `-s /bin/bash` | Uses a specific shell while switching users. | `su -s /bin/zsh john` |
| `-m` or `-p` | Preserves the current environment variables (does not reset `HOME`, `PATH`, etc.). | `su -m john` |
| `-g GROUP` | Runs the shell with a specified group instead of the default. | `su -g developers - john` |
| `-h` | Displays help information. | `su -h` |
| `-w, --whitelist-environment` | Whitelists specific environment variables. | `su -w PATH,HOME john` |

## **Key Differences: `su` vs `sg`**

| Feature | `su` (Switch User) | `sg` (Switch Group) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Purpose | Switches to another user | Runs commands under a specific group |
| Authentication | Requires user password | No password needed if already a group member |
| Shell Access | Can start a new shell | Only executes a command (does not start a new shell) |
| Common Use | Switching users or running commands as another user | Running commands under a different group |

---

## **When to Use `su` vs `sg`?**

- **Use `su` when** you need to switch to another user account or run commands as another user.
- **Use `sg` when** you need to execute commands as a specific group but stay as the same user.
