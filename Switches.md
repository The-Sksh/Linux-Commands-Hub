In Linux, **switches** (also known as options or flags) are modifiers used with commands to change their behavior or output. They are typically preceded by a single dash (`-`) for single-letter options or a double dash (`--`) for longer, descriptive options. Hereâ€™s an overview of common switches and how they are used.
